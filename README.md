# CPU Ping Reporter
The objective of this project is to compare CPU usage and ping response data in order to compare CPU performance based on pings to a machine.

## Tools used for project
### mpstat, ping

## Experiment 1
### This should compare the CPU usage of the machine doing the pinging
1. Compare CPU usage while pinging self on home network and school network depending on movability
2. Run mpstat script then run ping script
3. Graph and analyze data
4. Machine A - C works with attacker and victim
5. Machine D only works with home network

## Experiment 2
### This should compare the CPU usage of the machine while getting pinged
1. Compare CPU usage while pinging one computer on home and school network
2. Run cpu reporter script then run ping script 
3. Graph and analyze data

## Results
